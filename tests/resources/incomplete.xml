          <summary>Description of Boogiepop's appearance and purpose.</summary>
          It's something about the mysterious Boogiepop. Boogiepop is short, wears a black cape, and has a tall hat that's sort of like the one Maetel wore in Galaxy Express 999, only narrower. He's an assassin, and he can kill people instantly, without pain. He always does so when you are at your most beautiful, before you start to wither away, before you grow old and ugly.
